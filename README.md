# Objective 
The primary objective of our project is to make a mobile application that provides leukemia patients with a user-friendly and reliable platform to assist with nutritional planning. The app’s features aim to empower users by providing:​

- Instant nutritional information through an image analyzer that identifies food content from images.​

- Personalized meal planning based on the specific dietary requirements of leukemia patients.​

- Interactive support via a chatbot that answers diet, symptoms, and nutrition queries.​

# Future Works 
 - **Improvements**: Future planner versions could include more complex factors such as genetic data, lifestyle habits, or further integration with real-time health monitoring devices (like wearables) to continuously adjust dietary plans.​

    ​

- **Scalability**: The model could be extended to cover other medical conditions where diet is crucial, such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the system could be scaled to provide multilingual support or integrate with electronic health records (EHR) for more seamless operation. ​the ultimate diet planner
